- Generate a Python program that reads the sentences in @sentences.json and classifies them by running K-Means with K=3.
- generate a Taskfile.yml with two tasks: one for downloading and installing all the dependencies, and a second one for running the program.
- Plot the results using a scatter chart.
- In addition to plotting the results, generate a new JSON file named `sentences_clustered.json` that contains 3 lists - one for each cluster with all the sentences belonging to that cluster in it.
- Run KNN with K=5 on the new sentences in @new_sentences.json. Plot the results in the same chart using the colors of each group, but surround them with a circle to denote that they're new. Also print to console the cluster
 to which they were attached. 
- Generate a professional and well-structured README.md file for a software project following best practices. Include sections such as:
  - Project title
  - Features
  - Detailed description of the theory and solution
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Include screenshots that visualize the examples
